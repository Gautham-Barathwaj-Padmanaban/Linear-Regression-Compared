# Linear-Regression-Compared
A comparison of various methods for linear regression has been done through this code

Download all the files and store it in a folder. Run the LRn file alone in MATLAB/Octave. The dataset taken is a simple dataset comparing the population of a region to profits generated by a company. The following methods have been compared:
1. Gradient Descent
2. Normal Equation
3. Using fminunc - Quasi Newton
4. Using fminunc - Trust-Region

The code has been written in a generalized manner and thus can be reused to perform multivariate linear regression problems of all kinds using all the methods mentioned above.
